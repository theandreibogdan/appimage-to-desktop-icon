## Requirements

- Linux operating system
- Bash shell
- curl (for installation)
- Basic user permissions for local installations
- sudo privileges for system-wide installations

## How It Works

1. Validates the provided AppImage and icon files
2. Creates necessary directory structures
3. Copies the AppImage to the applications directory
4. Installs the icon in the appropriate location
5. Generates and installs the .desktop file
6. Updates desktop database for immediate availability

When uninstalling an application:
1. Removes the AppImage from the applications directory
2. Removes the desktop entry
3. Removes associated icons
4. Updates the desktop database

When removing the tool:
1. Detects installation location (user or system-wide)
2. Removes the script from the appropriate location
3. Cleans up PATH entries if necessary
4. Provides feedback about the removal process

## Directory Structure

The tool follows the XDG Base Directory specification:

For user installations:
- AppImages are stored in `~/.local/bin/`
- Icons are stored in `~/.local/share/icons/`
- Desktop entries are created in `~/.local/share/applications/`

For system-wide installations:
- AppImages are stored in `/usr/local/bin/`
- Icons are stored in `/usr/share/icons/`
- Desktop entries are created in `/usr/share/applications/`

## Desktop Environment Integration

After installation or uninstallation, the changes should appear in your applications menu. If you don't see the changes immediately:

1. Wait a few seconds for the desktop environment to refresh
2. Log out and log back in
3. For KDE: Run `killall plasmashell && plasmashell &`
4. For GNOME: Press ALT+F2, type 'r' and press Enter, or run `killall gnome-shell`
