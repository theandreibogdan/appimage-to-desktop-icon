```

### Examples

# System-wide installation

# Get help
appimage --help
```

## Requirements

- Linux operating system
- Bash shell
- curl (for installation)
- Basic user permissions for local installations
- sudo privileges for system-wide installations

## How It Works

1. Validates the provided AppImage and icon files
2. Creates necessary directory structures
3. Copies the AppImage to the applications directory
4. Installs the icon in the appropriate location
5. Generates and installs the .desktop file
6. Updates desktop database for immediate availability

## Directory Structure

The tool follows the XDG Base Directory specification:

For user installations:
- AppImages are stored in `~/.local/bin/`
- Icons are stored in `~/.local/share/icons/`
- Desktop entries are created in `~/.local/share/applications/`

For system-wide installations:
- AppImages are stored in `/usr/local/bin/`
- Icons are stored in `/usr/share/icons/`
- Desktop entries are created in `/usr/share/applications/`

## Desktop Environment Integration

After installation, the application should appear in your applications menu. If it doesn't appear immediately:

1. Wait a few seconds for the desktop environment to refresh
2. Log out and log back in
3. For KDE: Run `killall plasmashell && plasmashell &`
4. For GNOME: Press ALT+F2, type 'r' and press Enter, or run `killall gnome-shell`
